# NINJA-SHI7
NINJA-SHI7 (pronounced "Shizen" for "nature") is a fastq-to-combined-fasta processing pipeline. 

Please look in the "General" folder for an up-to-date readme. 

Additionally, a powerful new python-wrapped version is being developed here: https://github.com/knights-lab/shi7en (it is an early pre-release though)
